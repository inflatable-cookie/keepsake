# Vision

## Current Vision

Keepsake makes legacy plugins — VST2, VST3, AU v2, including 32-bit
binaries — first-class citizens in CLAP-capable hosts. Install it once, and
your old plugins appear in your plugin browser alongside everything else —
with their correct names, vendors, and categories. Each runs in its own
isolated process for crash safety and 32-to-64-bit bridging. No special host
support required.

The guiding principle: these plugins are not legacy baggage to be tolerated.
They are tools with genuine value that deserve to keep working.

The current release posture is conservative: the vision remains cross-platform
and multi-format, but the first public alpha should claim only what the repo
can prove in a fresh release window.

## Vision Artifacts

- [001-keepsake-vision.md](./001-keepsake-vision.md)

## Constraints

- Keepsake must never use or reference the Steinberg VST2 SDK.
- VeSTige (LGPL v2.1, clean-room ABI implementation) is the only permitted
  VST2 ABI surface.
- VST3 SDK (GPLv3) is permitted for VST3 hosting, in a subprocess only.
- CLAP is the outer plugin format — MIT licensed, no VST3 licence conflicts.
- 32-bit bridging is a first-class architectural concern.
- Keepsake is an Inflatable Cookie product distributed separately under LGPL
  v2.1; it is not bundled with Signal or Loophole.
- Legal and trademark guardrails from `docs/project-brief.md` are permanent
  constraints, not implementation choices.

## Next Task

Use the published `v0.1-alpha` support envelope as the current claim boundary,
and route follow-up work through `g03.001` post-alpha stabilization.
