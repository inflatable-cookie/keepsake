# G03 — Post-Alpha Stabilization Rollover

> **Superseded 2026-08-17:** `g03` absorbed back into `g02` as milestone
> `006`. See `docs/logs/2026-08/17-153800-g03-absorbed-into-g02.md`.

Date: 2026-04-17
Status: updated

## What changed

Opened `g03` as the active roadmap generation after `v0.1-alpha` publication.

This rollover does three things:

- stops front-door docs from pointing at already-complete `g02` release-cut work
- makes post-alpha stabilization the explicit active lane
- gives follow-up bugfix and claim-correction work a clean execution surface

## Active posture

- `g02` is complete
- `g03` is active
- first active milestone:
  - `docs/roadmaps/g03/001-post-alpha-stabilization-and-claim-corrections.md`

## Why the rollover happened

The release is out. The next useful work is no longer packaging or publishing.
It is:

- bug intake from the published alpha
- claim corrections if release wording drifts from evidence
- installer/runtime polish on the live artifact surface

Leaving `continue` pointed at `g02` would create churn and stale sequencing.

## Next Task

Execute `g03.001` on the first meaningful post-alpha issue cluster.
