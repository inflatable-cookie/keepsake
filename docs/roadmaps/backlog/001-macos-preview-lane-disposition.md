## Problem

Keepsake now has a coherent macOS posture:

- bridge-owned live editor is the supported interaction model
- preview / IOSurface remains diagnostic-only

The remaining open question is not product behavior. It is maintenance posture:

- should the retained preview implementation stay in tree as operator-only code
- or should it move onto a later removal/simplification track once its
  diagnostic value is no longer worth the maintenance cost

## Why this is backlog, not active

This is not blocking the current alpha support claim set.

The 2026-07 companion presentation/input experiment was removed after it failed
the interaction and complexity bars. The older operator-only IOSurface preview
remains in tree, so the final retain-or-remove decision for that diagnostic code
stays deferred.

The code is already demoted behind diagnostic posture. Removing it now would be
cleanup work, not release-critical work, and should not interrupt the active
alpha packaging / validation generation without a clearer payoff.

## Scope when promoted

1. Audit the remaining preview implementation surface:
   - `src/plugin_gui_mac_embed.mm`
   - `src/plugin_gui_mac_embed.h`
   - `src/bridge_gui_mac_iosurface.mm`
   - supporting plugin/bridge call sites
2. Decide one of:
   - retain as operator-only diagnostics with explicit maintenance bounds
   - remove entirely and simplify the macOS GUI surface
3. If retained:
   - confirm the remaining diagnostics are intentional and documented
   - verify the lane does not distort release/support claims
4. If removed:
   - delete unused code and config branches
   - remove obsolete docs references
   - update known issues / architecture / roadmap surfaces accordingly

## Promotion criteria

Promote this only when one of the following becomes true:

- the preview lane starts causing real maintenance drag or regressions
- release work is sufficiently complete that cleanup becomes the highest-value
  batch
- a maintainer explicitly wants a smaller, clearer macOS GUI surface before or
  after alpha publication

## Exit criteria

- the retained-or-removed status of the macOS preview lane is explicit
- docs and code comments match that outcome
- there is no implied support ambiguity around preview vs live editor posture

## Next

Leave this deferred until the alpha release lane no longer has higher-value
support, packaging, or validation work in front of it.
