# G01.016 — Soundcheck Integration

Status: superseded
Owner: Inflatable Cookie
Updated: 2026-07-16
Governing refs:
  - docs/contracts/006-process-isolation-policy.md

## Disposition

Keepsake will not query Soundcheck, launch Soundcheck, or depend on a
Soundcheck-owned API. Soundcheck should load Keepsake through CLAP and observe
the same behavior as every other host.

Plugin IDs and public host-neutral metadata remain available to any CLAP host.
Any richer catalog or screenshot behavior belongs to the host and must not
change Keepsake's runtime topology.

## Superseded Scope

Replace Keepsake's built-in config.toml isolation settings with queries
to Soundcheck's local HTTP API. When Soundcheck is running, Keepsake reads
plugin metadata and isolation config from it. When Soundcheck is not
available, Keepsake falls back to its own config.toml.

This plan is retained only as historical context. Do not execute it.

## Steps

### 1. Soundcheck API client

Implement a lightweight HTTP client in the factory that queries
Soundcheck's localhost API:

- `GET /plugins/{id}/isolation` — per-plugin isolation mode
- `GET /plugins` — full plugin list (could supplement or replace
  Keepsake's own scanning)
- Timeout/fallback: if Soundcheck is not running (connection refused),
  fall back to config.toml

### 2. Config priority chain

1. Soundcheck API (if running)
2. config.toml overrides
3. Built-in defaults

### 3. Bidirectional metadata

Keepsake could feed scan results back to Soundcheck:
- `POST /plugins` — report discovered plugins that Soundcheck might
  not know about (e.g., x86_64-only plugins detected via Rosetta bridge)
- Crash history from scan robustness (g01.014)

## Evidence Requirements

- Keepsake reads isolation settings from Soundcheck API
- Fallback to config.toml works when Soundcheck is not running
