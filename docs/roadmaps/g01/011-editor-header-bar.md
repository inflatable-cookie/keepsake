# G01.011 — Editor Header Bar

Auto-continuation: allowed within g01

## Scope

Add a thin toolbar to the top of every floating editor window showing plugin
info and quick-access controls. This is the first real UX surface Keepsake
owns — everything else is invisible bridging.

## Steps

### 1. Header bar UI (macOS first)

Add a native toolbar to the floating NSWindow in `bridge_gui_mac.mm`:

- Plugin name + format badge (VST2 / VST3 / AU)
- Architecture indicator (native / Rosetta / 32-bit)
- Isolation mode indicator + toggle (shared → per-binary → per-instance)
- Bridge process status (connected / crashed)
- no host- or companion-specific launch action

The toolbar sits above the VST2/VST3 editor content view. The editor
window height increases by the toolbar height.

### 2. Isolation toggle

Clicking the isolation indicator cycles through modes for this plugin.
The change is written back to config.toml. It takes effect on next
instantiation, not mid-session.

### 3. Platform stubs

Create stub header bars for Windows (HWND toolbar) and Linux (GTK/X11
toolbar) that display the same information. Implementation deferred to
g01.012.

## Evidence Requirements

- Screenshot of a VST2 editor with the Keepsake header bar visible
- Isolation mode readable from the toolbar
- Format and architecture badges correct
